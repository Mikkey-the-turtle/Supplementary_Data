[FILES' CAPTIONS]
  1) Supplementary_Data_for_TableS2_nucleotide_sequences_of_LTR-Rts_representatives.fasta
  Nucleotide sequences of the selected LTR-RTs representatives identified in the study. RT, RH, INT, and aRH domains of these LTR-RTs were used in phylogenetic reconstructions in Fig. 1B, 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1, S2. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Fig. S1.

  2) Supplementary_Data_for_Figure1B_FigureS1_concatenated_RT_RH_INT_alignment.fasta
  Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of concatenated RT, RH, and INT domains (presented in the same order) from diverse LTR-RTs representatives used for the phylogenetic reconstruction in Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Fig. S1. Borders between the domains are indicated by "X"-symbol columns in the alignment. 

  3) Supplementary_Data_for_FigureC1_FigureS2_RH_and_aRH_alignment.fasta
  Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the native RH and aRH domains from diverse LTR-RTs representatives, retroviruses and diverse taxa used for the phylogenetic reconstruction in Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Fig. S2. "[native_RH]" is added before sequences' names of the native RH domains of LTR-RTs.
  
  4) Supplementary_Data_for_Figure2_RH_aRH_alignment.fasta
  Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the native RH and aRH domains from diverse LTR-RTs representatives used to estimate the degree of active center sequence degradation upon the aRH acquisition (Fig. 2). Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Fig. S1. "[native_RH]" is added before sequences' names of the native RH domains.
