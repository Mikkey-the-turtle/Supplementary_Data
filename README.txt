[FILES' CAPTIONS]
  1) Supplementary_Data_nucleotide_sequences_of_LTR-RTs_representatives.fasta
  Nucleotide sequences of the selected LTR-RTs representatives identified in the study. RT, RH, INT, and aRH domains of these LTR-RTs were used in phylogenetic reconstructions in Fig. 1, 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Table S3.

  2) Supplementary_Data_for_Figure1_RT_alignment.fasta
  Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of RT domain from diverse LTR-RTs representatives used for the phylogenetic reconstruction in Fig. 1. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Table S3. 

  3) Supplementary_Data_for_Figure2_RH_and_aRH_alignment.fasta
  Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of the native RH and aRH domains from diverse LTR-RTs representatives, retroviruses and diverse taxa used for the phylogenetic reconstruction in Fig. 2. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Table S3. "[native_RH]" is added before sequences' names of the native RH domains of LTR-RTs. "[aRH-2]" is added before sequences' names of the distal aRH domains of LTR-RTs with structure 5.
  
  4) Supplementary_Data_for_FigureS2_INT_alignment.fasta
  Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of INT domain from diverse LTR-RTs representatives used for the phylogenetic reconstruction in Supplementary Fig. S2. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Table S3. 
  
  5) Supplementary_Data_for_FigureS2_RH_alignment.fasta
  Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of RH domain from diverse LTR-RTs representatives used for the phylogenetic reconstruction in Supplementary Fig. S2. Description of the sequences' headers as in Supplementary Table S3.
